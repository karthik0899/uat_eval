Given a new astronomical concept and a list of relevant branches from the Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT), suggest the single most appropriate branch for inclusion of this new concept. Provide the output in JSON format.

{context}

Consider the following:
1. The conceptual relationship between the new concept and each listed branch
2. The hierarchical structure of the UAT
3. The possibility of placing the new concept at any level within a branch, not just at the end

Provide the output in the following JSON format:

{{
  "new_concept": {{
    "name": "Name of the new concept",
    "definition": "Definition of the new concept"
  }},
  "suggested_placement": {{
    "branch": "Name of the most appropriate UAT branch",
    "location": "Specific location within the branch hierarchy (if applicable)",
    "justification": "Brief explanation of why this branch and placement are most appropriate"
  }}

  "summary": "The primary abstract focuses on the analysis of the first binary neutron star merger candidate detected in the third observing run of Advanced LIGO/Virgo, S190425z, and its potential association with a weak gamma-ray excess reported by INTEGRAL. The authors use gravitational wave measurements and upper limits on fluence from INTEGRAL to show that the observations are consistent with a relativistic Gaussian structured jet and a typical short-duration gamma-ray burst.",

    "name": "Relativistic Gaussian Structured Jet",
    "definition": "A highly collimated outflow of matter moving at relativistic speeds, characterized by a Gaussian profile in its energy distribution.",
    "explanation": "This type of jet is frequently invoked to explain the observed properties of gamma-ray bursts. The abstract highlights the use of a relativistic Gaussian structured jet to model the outflow from the S190425z merger and its potential connection to the observed gamma-ray excess.",
    "justification": "The primary abstract explicitly mentions using a 'relativistic Gaussian structured jet' to model the outflow from the merger, suggesting its importance in understanding the event.",
